<p>This is the UNOFFICIAL <i>Syncplay</i> client for Android. If you don't know Syncplay, have a look <a href='https://syncplay.pl/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. <i>Syncplay</i> synchronizes playback on different devices and makes sure everyone is watching the same thing at the same second, even if they're miles away.</p><p>What Syncplay Desktop needed is a Mobile client, people are using phones more than ever, so I dedicated myself to bringing its functionality to Android while keeping it compatible and interoperable with the Desktop version ! That means, users with both Syncplay Desktop and Syncplay BETA on Android can watch together. It supports the chat functionality, and most video formats ! (Working on the FFmpeg integration as of now, to make sure everyone can play all various formats). It's still a work in progress and it's really early in the alpha phase. There are various stuff that are still missing but exist in the official release. I am working on it slowly.</p><p><br><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Flawless interoperability with Syncplay's official desktop client and other Syncplay BETA Android clients.</li><li>Same base functionality as Syncplay for Desktop.
