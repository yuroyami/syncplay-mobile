        <item>For shared playlists to work, Syncplay needs to know where your media files are stored. Add your media folders in 'Settings > General > Media Directories for Shared Playlist'.</item>
        <item>Want to use the video player solo? Select a player, tap the Syncplay logo above, then choose 'Offline Mode'.</item>
        <item>You can always reset settings to their default states by going to 'Settings -> Advanced -> Reset to Default'</item>
        <item>Joining the same room repeatedly? Save it as a shortcut on your device for one-tap access by clicking the small button next to 'Join Room'.</item>
        <item>Each player has different strengths. If one doesn't work well with your video format, try another.</item>
        <item>Syncplay Mobile allows you to play media from direct links. However, YouTube is NOT supported, yet.</item>
        <item>If you want to minimize the room temporarily without leaving, you can go into "Picture-in-Picture" mode where the screen is a small floating screen above other apps.</item>
