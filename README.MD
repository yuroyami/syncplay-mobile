Syncplay Mobile is a unofficial Syncplay client brings the remarkable functionality of Syncplay PC client to the mobile platforms (Android and iOS). You can synchronize media playback with your friends, allowing you to watch videos together, even
when you're physically apart.

It includes real-time chat functionality, enabling seamless communication while enjoying synchronized playback on your Android or iOS device. You can use Syncplay Mobile with your friends who also use Syncplay Mobile, or Syncplay on PC.

**Requires at least Android 5.0 Lollipop or iOS 14.0**

## How to use

### How to use (Android)

Usage on Android is fairly simple:

- Download the latest release APK from [here](https://github.com/yuroyami/syncplay-mobile/releases/latest).
- Install the APK. If any installation issues arise, uninstall the previous version of the app before installing the new one.
- Open Syncplay. Specify a username of your choice, a room name of your choice (Tell your friends about it). Select a server from the list (Tell your friends about this one too)
- Click "Join Room". You will be taken to the Room screen. You're all set. Tell your friends to join the same room and server.
- ...and that's it. Load the same video file as your friends and enjoy the synchronized playback.

### How to use (iOS)

The iOS version cannot be distributed in package format (like Android's APKs). The only ways to install an app on iOS are to either compile this project by yourself on your macOS, or someone would kindly donate to host this app on the Apple app
store (the fee is a yearly $99). The iOS app compiles and runs without issues on any iOS device with 14.0 (I assume this can be lowered further but I didn't try).

## Capabilities

### General capability chart

The UI on both Android and iOS are 99.9% identical, minus some differences due to platform-specific behavior. This chart table will demonstrate things that work, and things that do not work, on each platform and video player.

## F.A.Q

> If my friend uses Syncplay on PC, can I watch with them ?

- Yes, you can. Syncplay Android is made to be interoperable.

> On Android, I get an error saying "App not installed" upon installing the app. What's wrong ?

- Uninstall the older version before installing the new one.

> Where is the iOS release ?

- The release has to be uploaded to the Apple app store to make it available to everyone, which I do not own. Volunteers are welcome.
